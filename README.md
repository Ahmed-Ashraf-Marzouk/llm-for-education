# 🧠 LLM for Education

**LLM for Education** is a research-focused project that explores fine-tuning and aligning large language models (LLMs) for educational applications. It combines cutting-edge techniques like LoRA/QLoRA, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), reward modeling, and quantization to build domain-specific educational agents.

---

## Features

- 🔧 Fine-tuning with LoRA/QLoRA using `peft`
- 🧑‍🏫 Instruction tuning and alignment with DPO
- ⚙️ Quantization support via `autoawq`, `gguf`, and `optimum`
- 📈 Experiment tracking with `wandb`, `TensorBoard`
- 📓 Notebook-based workflows with `qwen.ipynb`
